Basic syntax: command [arguments] -OPTIONS
Unix is case sensitive!

whoami
folder = directory, sub-directory
/  is the root
absolute path starts with /, rest are relative paths
..  (parent directory)
pwd   (print working directory)
cd []    plain cd takes you back to home (desiraju). (from wherever you are)
mkdir []
~            cd ~ takes you to desiraju home
ls

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

touch []     creates a text file      
ls -F             see if directorys are there, there will be a / before name
nano [] , pico [ ]      file editor
cat []          spills out entire content to terminal in one shot.
less and more are paging spells, spills out one page at a time.
less []        same as cat but :use arrows, space (next page) and q to quit
more []             less than less
cp [src] [dst]
mv [src] [renameIfuWant]
.                means current directory
cp srcfile ./folder (same as folder)
rm []   (permanently deletes the file)
rmdir []          opposite to mkdir
rm -rf []        recursive force, for directories & subdirectories (not rmdir)
cp -r [dirName] [newDirName]   : recursive copy dir
file [filename]   tells you what type of file it is

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

echo $shell (for tcsh,csh) $SHELL (for bash) : shell is interface with OS
history
press tab or (tabtab) to complete commands
PS1 =  "my new prompt>"   (PS1 stores your prompt, do echo $PS1 to see your current prompt)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

df  -h            disk filesystems partitions, human readable
Partitions help disk space from overflowing into one another. Make sure your "home" partition has enough space for your stuff.
If you fill up your partition, the others will be free for the computer to continue working normally

All files/folders in UNIX have permissions. When you belong to a group, all users in the group have the same permissions.
groups              see what groups you belong to

ls -l              shows lots of details (permissions,#links,owner,group the file belongs to, size,create time,filename)
(4)R-read
(2)W-create,edit,delete
(1)X-execute as a command
UGO: user, group, other. Example: -rwx-wx-r-x (734)
The first letter is: - for files and d for directory

chmod (-d|UGO|RWX)         change mode, you need to be the owner/user of the file to do chmod
chmod u+x,g+rw,og-r []     (add x to u, add rw to g, remove r from o&g) for a particular filename
chmod 746 []          111,100,110 (rwx are 421)
chmod 004 [] is -------r-- 

Unix has 6 file types
-  Plain old file
d  Directory (which is basically just a file)
l  Link  (hard link (copy) & soft link (pointer))
p  Pipe
b  Block device (like hard drive, has a buffer for I/O)
c  Character device (like modem, uses a stream)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
echo $path   (a variable that holds paths, example: /bin/ls)
cal                   calendar
man [spell]           manual
apropos xyz        (command to search all man pages)          
grep temp .         grabs all files/dirs that have 'temp' in their name
ls -l | grep d         pipe is a filter
>                   redirection, the destination file is overwritten. It is basically "->"
cal > july.txt       copies the output into a file
grep 8 < july.txt   This is basically "<-". Take july.txt and feed it to grep 8.
?                   (ls /bin/l? )
*                   (ls /bin/l* ,lists all files file that start with l)            
env 			 (list all environment variables)		
>>              append to end of the file
wc [file]   (count of lines,words, bytes for a file) (ls /bin | grep o | wc  : gives count of "o" commands)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

who                who else is logged into unix
cat /etc/passwd        List of all registered system users
cat /etc/group          groups info
passwd              to change passwd
su                     to become root, you need the root password. (root has rwx permission for everything!!!)
su - [otherUserName]         to become another user, u first need to be the root
sudo [command]        to just run a root-only command without actually being the root

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ps                 all your process status
ps -a              all processes by current users
ps -ax           all processes by all users, and all daemon process
ps -aux           all processes by all users, and all daemon process, along with memory info
jobs                shows current foreground, background spells cast along with PID
nano & [some-big-file]     to run the spell in the background. Your terminal prompt is ready to use.
ls /bin &          (this would end right way, will hardly be in the background)                
fg [process ID]   (bring a job to foreground)
kill [PID]
kill -9 [PID]    if kill doesnt work

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directories:
First Floor----------
/   The root of the entire file system
/bin  Contains all unix command files (binary executables)
/dev  Contains all connected devices (these are device files that can talk to the harware device)
/etc  Contains config files for the entire file system (rules and regulation of the file system)
/home  Contains all the users. In MacOS it is /users
/lib  Contains all info and libraries for the executables in /bin to run. In MacOS, this is /usr/lib
/sbin Contains all unix command files that only Admins can use. 
/var  Contains a set of variables that change with time
All the above folders are read only. Only Admins can write to them most of the time.

Second Floor------------
/usr/<same name from above>    This contains another set of bin,dev,etc,lib,sbin etc. Can be used by any user

Third Floor and above---------
All user directories
